# piscine_interview
A two-week long crash course on algorithms, data structures, and big O notation.  
Topics covered included: sorting algorithms, data structures such as trees, stacks, and queues, bitwise functions, recursion, and graph traversal.
In addition to those topics, we also participated in and gave mock interviews to test our knowledge on these topics.
