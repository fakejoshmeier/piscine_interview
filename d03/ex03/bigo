Space: O(n), where n is the depth of the recursion down both branches.  The last recursive call
does not increase the complexity of the operation as it is made as the final call and is thus
considered linear.
Time: O(n + h), where n is the number of elements and h is the height of the tree.
By iterating through all of the elements to a node and then through to the next level of the tree.
So, O(n + h);
